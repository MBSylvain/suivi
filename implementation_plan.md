# Push Project to GitHub

This plan outlines the steps to push the existing `suivi` project to a GitHub repository.

## Proposed Changes

### Git Configuration
- Verify current Git status and remotes.
- Commit any unstaged changes.
- Add a GitHub remote if it doesn't exist.
- Push the local `main` (or `master`) branch to GitHub.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify that the repository is visible and updated on GitHub.
- Check that all files are correctly pushed.
